\subsection{Task 3: Turbulence Analysis in 3D for the Optimized Geometry}
\label{sec:task3}

In this part of the project, the valvular conduit is examined in 3 dimensions using the optimal geometric dimensions including the optimum $L$ value found from \ref{sec:task2results}. The Reynolds number for this setup is set to be $10^4$ while the optimizations are done according to Re = 724. Simulations have been conducted in both directions using both the $k - \epsilon$ and $k - \omega$ solvers. To obtain the Reynolds number of $10^4$, the parameters are set as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho = 5000$kg/$m^3$
    \item V = 0.02 m/s
    \item $\mu = 10^-3$Pa.s
\end{itemize}

Following this, using the pressure contours and streamline plots for both directions, the diodicities are calculated and the effects are discussed.
